  generating Intermediate Representation

Caution:
  can compile, but cannot link, following functions haven't been defined
  extern fun tmpvar_new_anon (): tmpvar_t
  extern fun tmpvar_new_name (v: v1ar): tmpvar_t
    
  extern fun funlab_make_anon (): funlab
  extern fun funlab_make_name (f: v1ar): funlab
  
  extern fun funent_add (fl: funlab, ent: funent): void
  
  extern fun aux_exp_ret_app (loc: loc, e_fun: e1xp, e_arg: e1xp,
    res: &instrlst, tmp_ret: tmpvar): valprim

  have problem in dealing with recursive function definition


Record:
  Treat all functions as unary function
  
  ?? handle this --> not support since c is not function definition
  val rec a = lam (x: int): int -> int => let
    val f = lam (x: int) => x + 1
    val d = c
  in f end
  and c = a (1)

 
  ?? handle this --> not support since c is not function definition
  val rec a = lam (x: int): int -> int => c
  and c = a (1)
