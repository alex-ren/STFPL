To build the program, please run
>> make all

At this moment, the compiler cannot generate C code. "trans2.dats" and "trans_cpp.dats" cannot compile.

To do the test, simply run
>> ./tester < TEST/xxx.stfpl

and observe the output to check the functionality of type checking.

Updates:
  Add no. of parameters to the function type.

  Add support of list.

  Collect information for closure and put it along with the functions.

















Caution:

Record (for functionality)
  Type inference including tuple of variant length

  Generating C++ file: supporting recusive function call, function as first class object

Record (for developers)
  Treat all functions as unary ones in the C++ level.
  
  ?? handle this --> not supported since c is not function definition
  val rec a = lam (x: int): int -> int => let
    val f = lam (x: int) => x + 1
    val d = c
  in f end
  and c = a (1)

 
  ?? handle this --> not supported since c is not function definition
  val rec a = lam (x: int): int -> int => c
  and c = a (1)

About Type Checking / Inference
  The number of arguments is part of the function type.
  The type of a function may be:
    <1> (X, Y, Z) -> R
    <3> (X, Y, Z) -> R
    <0> () -> R
    <0> () -> ()

  
  ===============================
  val rec a = lam (x) => b (x, y)
  and b = lam (x) => 3
  ===============================
  For this kind of vardec, the type checker would scan twice. First time,
  it would try to get the types of a and b if they are functions. Second
  time it does the type checking based on that a and b are of such types.


  ===============================
  val a = lam (x) => 4
  val b = lam (x) => 3
  ===============================
  For this kind of vardec, the type checker only scans once. If a and b
  are not type annotated, then their types are set according to their
  definition.


  unit is a type and it's equivalent to writing ().


  Refer to TEST/list.stfpl for usage of list type
  Library functions of list operations such as list_cons are constructors.
  They can be applied to different kinds list. But the user-defined functions
  such as 
  ===============================
  val fn = lam (x: list, y: list): list
  ===============================
  is not a template function at all. Its type needs to be inferred. And once
  its type is inferred, then it is fixed.

  
  So far, the program should not go on to trans2, if trans1 has type conflicts.
  todo check the result of trans1 to see whether there is exp1 whose type
  hasn't been inferred yet.


  statter and stammer
  It's pointless to talk about the type of of a closure since different kinds
  of closures can be used as same kind of function.


  Be careful:
  Different e1xp nodes of a tree can have the "same" v1ar. But when we copy
  the tree, then different e1xp nodes contain different v1ar's though
  those v1ar's may be structurally equivalent (but not identical).


  Treat every function as a closure.


  val f = lam (x) => (lam (y) => f y)  ?????


  What is a valprim? What is it used for?


  a function type (not closure) whose first parameter is env,
  is the fix function or the recursive function,
  then we should pass the current env as the first argument.

  # a function type (not closure) whose first parameter isn't env,
  # then it's the library function


  ****The following code causes segment fault for the type checking.
  let
    val fn = fix f (g, x: int): int => f (f, 3)
  in
    ()
  end

  ****The following code should work.
  let
    val foo = lam (x: int -> int, y: int) => x (y)
  
    val q = 3
    val fn = fix f (x: int): int => if x > 0 then q else foo (f, x - 1)
  
    val rec fn1 = fix f (x: int): int => if x > 0 then q else foo (fn1, x - 1)
    
  in
    ()
  end
  

  **** type error
  val f: (int, int) -> int = lam (x: (int, int)) => 3

  (int, int) -> int is translate to <<2>>(int, int) -> int
